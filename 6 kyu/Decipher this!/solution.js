// You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

// For each word:

// the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
// the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
// Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

// Examples

// decipherThis('72olle 103doo 100ya'); // 'Hello good day'
// decipherThis('82yade 115te 103o'); // 'Ready set go'

//switch the second and last letters with each other. 
// replace the second letter with its character code



function decipherThis(str) {
  const word = str.replace(/^(.)(.*)(.)$/, '$3$2$1');
  return word;
    
}; 

console.log(decipherThis('72eva 97 103o 97t 116sih 97dn 115ee 104wo 121uo 100o'), 'Have a go at this and see how you do');
