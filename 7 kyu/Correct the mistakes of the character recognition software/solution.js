// When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

// Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

// S is misinterpreted as 5
// O is misinterpreted as 0
// I is misinterpreted as 1
// The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.


function correct(string)
{  
 let result =  string
     .replaceAll('5', 'S')
     .replaceAll('0', 'O')
     .replaceAll('1', 'I')
return result
}

console.log(correct("L0ND0N"),"LONDON");
console.log(correct("DUBL1N"),"DUBLIN");
console.log(correct("51NGAP0RE"),"SINGAPORE");
console.log(correct("BUDAPE5T"),"BUDAPEST");
